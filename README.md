RedDevils1999 Museum Tour &amp; AR Application
Team : RedDevils1999

Our Objective was to make Every exhibit at the museum an interactive element. We wanted to make sure every exhibit at the museum to invoke emotions that were born out of every title win, of breathtaking goal, last minute clinchers and the moments that truly made our club great.

We went about trying to achieve this in the following ways.

Museum Tour AR App: We set about first, to tell the story of Every Title win, to do this we created a demo setup of five trophies, procured locally, which were of varied sizes and complexity and created a image recognition app and trained the app to recognize these trophies. For the demo these trophies represented a title in united history. The app scans these trophies and plays a video of the pivotal moments of that title win. Enabling the visitor to relive the moments that were truly magical.

Manchester United AR App: We created an AR app which allows the users to take a picture with their favorite superstar. We created a AR app that allows fans to take picture with Pogba, we had a photo session with our AR app and our favorite superstar Pogba :) . We took it a step further by creating various AR scenarios which were fun and would be a great way to increase fan engagement.

The Demo videos and the apk of both app have been uploaded.

Hope you use them and have some fun :)
